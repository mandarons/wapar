# Advanced Analytics Dashboard

## Overview

The Advanced Analytics Dashboard provides sophisticated performance metrics and market insights by calculating and visualizing complex analytics from existing API data. It helps understand app performance, market penetration, and growth patterns without requiring additional API endpoints.

## Feature Description

### Purpose

- Provide deeper insights into app performance beyond basic metrics
- Compare performance against industry benchmarks
- Analyze geographic market distribution and diversity
- Offer composite scores combining multiple metrics
- Help identify growth opportunities and areas for improvement

### Key Metrics

#### 1. Install-to-Activity Conversion Rate

**Formula**: `(monthlyActive / totalInstallations) × 100`

**Description**: Measures what percentage of total installations are monthly active users. Higher percentages indicate better user retention and engagement.

**Industry Benchmark**: Typical SaaS applications achieve 20-30% engagement

#### 2. Geographic Diversity Index

**Formula**: `1 - Σ(marketShare²)` (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)

**Description**: Measures market distribution concentration across countries:

- 0 = Complete concentration (one country has all installations)
- 1 = Perfect distribution (all countries have equal shares)

Higher values indicate better geographic distribution and lower market risk.

#### 3. Engagement Quality Score

**Formula**: `(engagementRate) × (1 + diversityIndex)`

**Description**: A composite metric combining engagement rate with geographic diversity. Provides a holistic view of app health considering both user activity and market distribution.

**Range**: 0-2 (typically 0-1.5)

#### 4. Market Penetration Score

**Formula**: Score 0-100 based on engagement rate vs industry benchmarks

**Description**: Compares engagement rate against industry standards:

- 90-100: Excellent (>50% engagement)
- 60-89: Good (25-50% engagement)
- 40-59: Fair (15-25% engagement)
- 0-39: Needs Improvement (<15% engagement)

## User Interface

   - Composite metric description

4. **Market Penetration Card** (Dynamic color)
   - Performance score
   - Health indicator emoji
   - Rating and description
   - Industry benchmark reference

#### Performance Insights Section

Contextual analysis with four insight areas:

- 💡 **Engagement Analysis**: Comparison against industry standards
- 🌍 **Market Distribution**: Geographic risk and appeal analysis
- ⭐ **Quality Score**: Combined engagement and reach assessment
- 🎯 **Competitive Position**: Market tier positioning

#### Comparative Benchmarks Section

Visual comparison showing:

- User's actual engagement rate
- Progress bar visualization
- Three benchmark tiers:
  - Typical SaaS: 20-30%
  - Good Performance: 40-50%
  - Excellent: >50%

## Responsive Design

The dashboard adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Single column layout
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: Two-column grid
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: Four-column grid for metric cards

calculateInstallToActivityRate(monthlyActive, totalInstallations);

// Geographic Diversity Index (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)
calculateGeographicDiversityIndex(countryData, totalInstallations);

// Engagement Quality Score
calculateEngagementQualityScore(monthlyActive, totalInstallations, diversityIndex);

// Market Penetration Score
calculateMarketPenetrationScore(monthlyActive, totalInstallations);

```

#### Reactive Calculations in Component

```typescript
// Calculate all metrics reactively
$: advancedMetrics = calculateAllMetrics(
	data.monthlyActive,
	data.totalInstallations,
	data.countryToCount
);

// Get performance ratings
$: penetrationRating = getPerformanceRating(advancedMetrics.marketPenetrationScore);
$: diversityRating = getDiversityRating(advancedMetrics.geographicDiversityIndex);
```

### Test IDs

For E2E testing, the following test IDs are available:

- `conversion-rate-card` - Conversion rate metric card
- `conversion-rate-value` - Conversion rate percentage
- `diversity-index-card` - Geographic diversity card
- `diversity-index-value` - Diversity percentage

## Mathematical Background

### Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)

The Geographic Diversity Index uses the HHI formula, commonly used in economics to measure market concentration:

```
HHI = Σ(s₁² + s₂² + ... + sₙ²)
```

Where `s` represents the market share of each country.

The diversity index is then calculated as:

```
Diversity = 1 - HHI
```

This provides an intuitive 0-1 scale where higher values indicate better distribution.

### Industry Benchmarks

The benchmarks used in this dashboard are based on typical SaaS application metrics:

- **Average SaaS Engagement**: 20-30% of users are monthly active
- **Good SaaS Engagement**: 40-50% monthly active
- **Excellent SaaS Engagement**: >50% monthly active

These benchmarks are used to contextualize the app's performance.
