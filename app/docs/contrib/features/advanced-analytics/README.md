## What It Does

- **Calculates** advanced metrics like geographic diversity and engagement quality
- **Compares** performance against industry benchmarks (SaaS standards)
- **Visualizes** data with color-coded metric cards and progress bars
- **Provides** contextual insights and recommendations
- **Works** entirely client-side with no additional API calls

## Key Metrics

| Metric                   | What It Measures                                 | Good Performance |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **Conversion Rate**      | % of installations that are monthly active       | >40%             |
| **Geographic Diversity** | How well distributed across countries (HHI)      | >60%             |
| **Engagement Quality**   | Composite score: engagement × (1 + diversity)    | >70%             |
| **Market Penetration**   | Performance vs industry benchmarks (0-100 scale) | >80              |

## Files

- `app/src/lib/analytics.ts` - Core calculation library (293 lines including JSDoc)
- `app/src/lib/analytics.test.ts` - Unit tests (48 tests, 100% coverage)
- `app/src/routes/+page.svelte` - Dashboard UI (~200 lines for dashboard section)
- `app/tests/test.ts` - E2E tests (11 new tests)

## Usage

The dashboard displays automatically on the main page after the Engagement Health section. It reactively updates when data changes.

## Documentation

See [FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md](./FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md) for:

- Detailed metric explanations
- Mathematical formulas
- Interpretation guides
- Technical implementation details
- Example calculations

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
bun run test:unit src/lib/analytics.test.ts

# Run all tests
bun run test
```

## Performance

- ✅ No additional API calls
- ✅ Client-side calculations only
- ✅ Reactive caching by Svelte
- ✅ Minimal DOM updates
- ✅ Lightweight (~500 lines including tests and UI)

## Industry Benchmarks

Based on typical SaaS application metrics and industry observations:

- **Typical**: 20-30% engagement (industry standard for SaaS applications)
- **Good**: 40-50% engagement (above average performance)
- **Excellent**: >50% engagement (top-tier applications)

## Development

The analytics library is designed to be:

- **Modular**: Each calculation is a separate function
- **Testable**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Reusable**: Functions can be used independently
- **Maintainable**: Clear documentation and examples
