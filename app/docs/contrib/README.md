## 🎯 Feature Documentation

Each feature in the `features/` directory follows a standardized documentation structure to ensure comprehensive coverage of:

### Technical Aspects

- **Implementation details** - Code structure, APIs, and architecture
- **Change summaries** - Modified files, added functionality, and impact
- **Quality metrics** - Test coverage, performance, and code quality

### User Experience

- **Feature documentation** - Usage patterns and interaction flows
- **Visual specifications** - UI mockups, layouts, and design patterns
- **Accessibility** - Compliance with WCAG guidelines and best practices

### Development Workflow

- **Quick references** - Fast lookup for developers, testers, and designers
- **Verification checklists** - Pre-deployment testing and validation
- **Integration guides** - How features work with existing system

## 📖 Documentation Standards

### Naming Convention

- Feature folders use kebab-case: `feature-name-slug`
- Documentation files use consistent naming across all features
- README.md serves as the entry point and index for each feature

### Content Requirements

- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects from technical to user-facing
- **Accurate**: Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- **Accessible**: Write for different audience levels (technical and non-technical)
- **Visual**: Include diagrams, mockups, and code examples where helpful

### Quality Standards

- All code examples must be tested and functional
- Screenshots and mockups should reflect current UI state
- Cross-references between documents should be maintained
- Documentation should be reviewed as part of the development process

## 🔧 Adding New Features

When implementing a new feature:

1. **Create feature folder** in `features/` with appropriate slug
2. **Copy documentation template** from existing feature
3. **Customize all template files** with feature-specific information
4. **Update parent README files** to include the new feature
5. **Ensure completeness** before marking feature as ready

### Documentation Checklist

- [ ] README.md with feature overview and navigation
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with technical details
- [ ] FEATURE_DOCUMENTATION.md with user experience guide
- [ ] UI_MOCKUP.md with visual specifications
- [ ] QUICK_REFERENCE.md for all stakeholder types
- [ ] CHANGES.md documenting all modifications
- [ ] VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md for quality assurance

## 🎨 WAPAR Context

### Application Architecture

The WAPAR frontend is built with:

- **SvelteKit** - Full-stack framework with SSR capabilities
- **Skeleton UI** - Component library providing consistent design system
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom theme

### Development Principles

- **Component-driven** - Reusable UI components with Skeleton UI
- **Type-safe** - TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- **Accessible** - WCAG AA compliance and semantic HTML
- **Performance-focused** - Optimized builds and lazy loading
- **Mobile-first** - Responsive design with progressive enhancement

### Integration Points

Features typically integrate with:

- **Backend API** - Cloudflare Workers with D1 database
- **External APIs** - Home Assistant analytics and other data sources
- **Theme system** - Custom Wapar theme built on Skeleton UI
- **Testing framework** - Playwright for e2e testing

## 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

### For Documentation

1. **Follow established patterns** from existing feature documentation
2. **Include visual examples** where they add clarity
3. **Test all code examples** to ensure they work correctly
4. **Update cross-references** when adding or modifying content
5. **Review for accuracy** before submitting changes

### For Features

1. **Document during development** rather than after completion
2. **Include accessibility considerations** in design and implementation
3. **Provide comprehensive test coverage** with verification checklists
4. **Consider mobile experience** in all feature decisions
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** unless explicitly breaking
